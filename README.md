# DCNN-Power-Map

This repository contains the source code and data related to the DCNN based power map estimation. It contains the following files:  
- "DCNN.py" : the source code for the training and testing of the proposed DCNN architecture.  
- "p_sensors.csv" : contains the thermal data collected using the embedded sensors and used as the input features to the DCNN network.  
- "p_images.csv" : contains the power map data, as estimated by the Alternating-BPI, and used by the DCNN network as the target output.  
- "offline_training.drawio-2.png" : shows the offline training procedure of the proposed DCNN.
- "DCNN_final.png" : shows the architecture of the proposed DCNN.
